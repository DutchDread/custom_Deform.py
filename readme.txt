This code was made for my master, it is designed to look at
a piece of geometry, see how much it was deformed by some deformer.
then use that deformation info as a basis to add a third deformation.

The inputs are as follows:
1: A piece of geometry.
2: The same geometry, but deformed.
3: A target deformation that you only wish to enable on deformed areas.

the output:
Maya mesh data.
